# react-typescript-boilerplate

**Minimalistic** boilerplate for React apps with typescript. When I say minimalistic, I mean it.

## What is in the box?

- React
- TypeScript
- Webpack with Hot Module Replacement
- Sass (Easily removable/replaceable)
- Bootstrap 4 (Easily removable/replaceable)
- Font-Awesome (Easily removable/replaceable)
- Express (Easily removable/replaceable)

## Installing

- `npm clone https://github.com/andrerpena/react-typescript-boilerplate.git`
- Set the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to `development`
- `npm install`
- Go to `packages.json` and change the project name to whatever you want

## Running

You're going to need 2 `sheels`:

1. `npm run hot-server`: This will start `webpack-dev-server`.
2. `npm start`: This will start the actual project

Now... 

- `localhost:4000`: Will display the application
- `localhost:4000/api/test`: Will call the sample api
